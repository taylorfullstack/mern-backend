# MERN Stack App

## Description

The backend of this project was built by following the OpenClassrooms course:

[Passez au Full Stack avec Node.js, Express, et MongoDB](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/6390246-passez-au-full-stack-avec-node-js-express-et-mongodb)

Don't speak French? The course is also available in English:

[Go Full-Stack with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/5614116-go-full-stack-with-node-js-express-and-mongodb)

Note: The French version of the course was updated more recently.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- NPM (npm is included with Node.js installation)
- A code editor (I use VSCode)

## Installation

### Frontend

From the root of your project directory, run the command:

`git clone https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/go-fullstack-v3-fr.git frontend`

Then run:

`cd frontend`
`npm install`
`npm run start`

### Backend

You should follow the course to learn how to build the backend.

However, if you want to test out my implementation:

From the root of your project directory, run the command:

`git clone https://github.com/taylorfullstack/mern-backend backend`

Then run:

`cd backend`
`npm install`
`nodemon server`
